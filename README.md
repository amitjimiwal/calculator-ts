Sure, here's an example of how you can add a "Test Cases" section to your README.md file for the "calculator-tsproject" repository:

## Test Cases

The calculator-tsproject comes with a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application. The test cases are implemented using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a popular JavaScript testing framework.

To run the tests locally, make sure you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the **Getting Started** section.

### Running Tests

1. Navigate to the root of the project where the `package.json` file is located.

2. Run the following command to execute the tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Jest will then run the test suite and display the results in your terminal.

### Writing Tests

If you want to contribute to this project or add more test cases, you can find the test files in the `__tests__` folder located at the root of the project.

The test files are organized in a way that each functionality of the calculator has its own separate test file. For example:

- `yourfucntion.test.ts`: Contains test cases for the your functionality.


Feel free to add more test cases to ensure full test coverage and verify the edge cases.
